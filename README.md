### Hi, I'm Snaky1a, also known as Whitesnake1995

### I love Windows XP, coffee, and winter. I also enjoy collecting Windows beta builds.

### Furthermore, I'm the maintainer of a XP-Apps: a repository with programs that can run on Windows XP with the [One-Core-API](https://github.com/Skulltrail192/One-Core-API-Binaries).
